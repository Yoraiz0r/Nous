# What is it?
Style settings is an obsidian plugin that allows snippet, theme, and plugin CSS files to define a set of configuration options. It then allows users to see all the tweakable settings in one settings pane. Style Settings allows both toggling classes on and off the `body` element, as well as setting numeric, string, and color CSS variables.

# How do I use it?
If you use [[Obsidian Supercharged Links|Supercharged Links]], then any styles you've established in that plugin will appear automatically in this plugin's [[Settings Window]] after you've enabled it. You can then press on each entry and customize its color, text styling, prefixes, suffixes, and other presentation to your whims.
