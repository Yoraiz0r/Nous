# What is it?
Folder Note is an obsidian plugin that adds a description note to a folder, and lets you generate card-style overview of a folder.

[View on Github](https://github.com/xpgo/obsidian-folder-note-plugin)
# How do I use it?
Enable the plugin in the [[Settings Window]], and after that you can create a folder note by ctrl+clicking on a folder in the file explorer panel. To view said folder note, just click on the folder. 

The note itself is just a note named `_about_` in the folder which you clicked.

> [!WARNING] Conflict with Dataview
> If you're using dataview, you may want to open Folder Note's [[Settings Window]] and change the "Note File Method" to "Index File". This is because the folder note's notes are near their related folder by default, and will otherwise be picked up by dataview.
