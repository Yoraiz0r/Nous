# What is it? 
Obsidian callouts is a version of the native [[Obsidian Callouts]] that is supported for use on lists. 

For example, A standard obsidian callout block might look like this:

> [!example]
> Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet

But a list callout would look like:

 - @ Hello, I am a list callout!

With list callouts you can easily highlight a line and add context.
