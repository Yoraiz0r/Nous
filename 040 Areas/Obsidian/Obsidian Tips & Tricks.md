> [!TIP] Callouts
> These tips are all in callout boxes! To quickly wrap some text in a callout, select it with the cursor and use the 'Callout' command in the [[Quick Switcher]] !

> [!Tip]+ Collapsing Callouts
> You can allow a callout to be collapsed and expanded by designating a `+` for a default-expanded callout and `-` for a default-collapsed callout right after its closing bracket!

> [!TIP] ⭐Adding Emojies⭐
> You can use Windows' emoji menu by pressing `winkey + .` which opens a window to see all your available emojies. They're rendered nicely in Obsidian and can be used in note titles or signals specified by the various available [[Obsidian Plugins this vault uses|plugins]].

> [!TIP] New Files from Quick Switcher
> You can create new files in Obsidian quickly by using the [[Quick Switcher]] (default hotkey Ctrl+O), typing the full path to the file you'd want to make without extension, and press enter. e.g. `040 Areas/Obsidian/Obsidian Tips & Tricks`!

> [!TIP] Settings Window Hotkey
> You can open the [[Settings Window]] with `Ctrl + ,` , this is useful if you're setting up a new library and constantly tweaking the plugins which you use. 

> [!TIP] New File Hotkey
> You can create a new file immediately with the `ctrl + n` shortcut! Useful if you need a quick note.

> [!TIP] Disabling auto tick/bracket completion
> You may grow aggitated if you try to manually type a lot of your tags and links, by how obsidian adds more than you intended. You can disable this behavior in the [[Settings Window]] under the "Editor" tab, the option is named "Auto pair Markdown syntax" & "Auto pair brackets".

> [!TIP] Find connected notes
> You can easily find outgoing links & backlinks if you enable the "Outgoing Links" & "Backlinks" Core plugins in the [[Settings Window]] !
> 
> For Backlinks, you may want to open its options (gear icon to the right) and enable "Backlinks in document" which will add them to the bottom of every open note.
