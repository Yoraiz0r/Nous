# What is it?
Icon Folder is an obsidian plugin that lets you add icons to folders.

# How do I use it?
After enabling the plugin, go to its [[Settings Window]] and under "Icon Packs", add some predefined icon packs. 

Then, Right click any folder in Obsidian's file explorer and click "Change Icon". A prompt will show up letting you choose what icon you'd like to give that folder.
