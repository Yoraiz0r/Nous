# What is this?
Supercharged links allows you to style the links in your Obsidian vault based on your notes metadata! You can, for example, automatically add colors and emojis to the links.

This plugin is often used with the [[Obsidian Style Settings|Style Settings]] plugin.

[View on Github](https://github.com/mdelobelle/obsidian_supercharged_links)
# How do I use it?
After enabling the plugin go to its [[Settings Window]] and write down some attributes into the "Target Attributes for styling" input field. Then under "Styling" press the button to the right of "New selector". This will open a prompt that lets you style the attribute with whatever configuration you'd like.

After you've defined some styles one way or another (such as with the [[Obsidian Style Settings|Style Settings]] plugin), you can customize how each link registered will respect them via the "edit" button's prompt. (e.g. disable certain style settings for certain links)
